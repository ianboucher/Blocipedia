Wikis are a great way to collaborate on community-sourced content. Whether the wiki is for a hobby or work-related project, this app lets users create their own wikis and share them publicly or privately with other collaborators.

It includes wiki search with ElasticSearch and Twitter Typeahead, live markdown previews and the option make wikis private by subscribing via Stripe integration.
